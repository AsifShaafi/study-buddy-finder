Issues encountered when setting up the project:
- General note: road-trip-planner is stated as the name of the project a few times; not sure if that's intentional or not.
- Backend
    - The tutorial for creating a MySQL image does not map the container's port to localhost's on creation, so initially I couldn't connect to the database. Adding `-p 3306:3306` fixed the issue (making the complete command: `docker run --name=mysql01 -d mysql/mysql-server:latest`).
    - I do not have IntelliJ Ultimate edition, so I use the Community edition instead. The Community edition does not provide the Database Connection view; I had to download a plugin (called Database Navigator) to get this functionality. The following errors could be due to that.
        - I had to provide a user and password to connect to the database, but root was not allowed. I would get an error saying: "X.X.X.X is not allowed to access the database". To get around this, I had to manually (in the MySQL container) add a new user to the database associated with the IP address given in the error message, and give that user full privileges. After making this change, I could connect without issue.
        - The plugin does not let you create new schema through IntelliJ, so I had to do that step manually inside the running MySQL container.
    - Community doesn't have support for Spring Boot built-in; I'm assuming this is the reason I could not get the project to run in the end. There is no SpringBoot Run Configuration to select, and I wasn't able to create a working configuration from scratch. Forcing the project to run (by clicking the green play button next to the RoadTripApplication class) would expose the API on port 8080, but would always return a 404.
- Frontend
    - I could not get past step 2. Running `npm init` put me in a few command line prompts that I just left blank, as I wasn't sure if I needed to put anything specific. Running `npm install --location=global yarn` after that would give me an error similar to "Could not resolve dependency: peer react@"^16.8.0"..."
